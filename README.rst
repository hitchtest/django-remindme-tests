Install and Run Tests
=====================

There is a three step process to install and run the tests::

Mac OS X pre-installation steps
-------------------------------

On Mac OS X, you must also first manually perform a couple of steps::

    1) Download and install firefox

    2) brew install npm ; npm install -g less


Known Issues
------------

* On Fedora 20: "curl https://hitchtest.com/init.sh" fails with "curl: (35) Cannot communicate securely with peer: no common encryption algorithm(s)". Use wget instead.

* On some Linux distributions running in a VM: the message "log timeout appears". This is likely caused by the timezone being set incorrectly.

* On some Linux distributions the site appears unstyled. This is due to a bug with libfaketime running with node-less. See: https://github.com/wolfcw/libfaketime/issues/63 (no fix available yet)

* This error occurs on Mac OS X but can be safely ignored::
